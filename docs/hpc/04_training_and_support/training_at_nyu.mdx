### HPC Caprentry tutorials for Greene

- **[Introduction to using the shell in a High-Performance Computing context](https://nyuhpc.github.io/hpc-shell/)**: This lesson provides an introduction to the bash shell aimed at researchers who will be using the command line to use remote, high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The material is also suitable for teaching the use of the shell for any remote, advanced computing resources.

- **[An Introduction to High Performance Computing](https://nyuhpc.github.io/hpc-intro/)**: This lesson teaches the basics of interacting with high-performance computing (HPC) clusters through the command line.

### Introductory Videos
