# HPC Accounts for Sponsored External Collaborators

External (non-NYU) collaborators can access, with proper sponsorship, the NYU HPC Environment.

-   The first step is to sponsor a collaborator for an NYU netid (if they do not have one already).  A department administrator or the faculty sponsor must submit the [Affiliate Management Form](https://identity.it.nyu.edu/identityiq/plugins/pluginPage.jsf?pn=AffiliateManagement) (the link is only accessible over VPN, or within NYU-Net).
-   Once a netid for the external collaborator is created, the collaborator must submit the [Request for an NYU HPC account](https://identity.it.nyu.edu/identityiq/workitem/commonWorkItem.jsf#/commonWorkItem/session).
:::tip
-   The collaborator must setup [VPN access][nyu vpn link] to be able to access the HPC account request form.
-   The collaborator must enter in the account request form the Netid of the sponsoring NYU Full time faculty
-   The collaborator should select "External Collaborator" as Affiliation, when filing the HPC account request form.
:::
-   Once the HPC request is submitted, the sponsoring faculty will receive an email with a [link to approve (or deny) the HPC account request](https://identity.it.nyu.edu/identityiq/workitem/workItems.jsf#/workItems) for the external collaborator. The [account approval link](https://identity.it.nyu.edu/identityiq/workitem/workItems.jsf#/workItems) can only be accessed [over VPN][nyu vpn link].
:::note
Once the sponsoring faculty approves the account request, the HPC account is created within one hour.
:::
-   Once the HPC account is created, the external collaborator can access HPC resources as described here.

:::note
As with all sponsored accounts, HPC accounts for external collaborators are valid for a period of 12 months, at which point a renewal process is required to continue access to the NYU HPC environment.
