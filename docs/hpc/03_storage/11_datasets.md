# Datasets

## General
The HPC team makes available a number of public sets that are commonly used in analysis jobs. The data sets are available Read-Only under
-   `/scratch/work/public/ml-datasets/`
-   `/vast/work/public/ml-datasets/`

We recommend to use version stored at `/vast` (when available) to have better read performance

:::note
For some of the datasets users must provide a signed usage agreement before accessing

## Format
Many datasets are available in the form of '.sqf' file, which can be used with Singularity.
For example, in order to use coco dataset, one can run the following commands 
```sh
$ singularity exec \
  --overlay /<path>/pytorch1.8.0-cuda11.1.ext3:ro \
  --overlay /vast/work/public/ml-datasets/coco/coco-2014.sqf:ro \
  --overlay /vast/work/public/ml-datasets/coco/coco-2015.sqf:ro \
  --overlay /vast/work/public/ml-datasets/coco/coco-2017.sqf:ro \
  /scratch/work/public/singularity/cuda11.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu18.04.sif /bin/bash

$ singularity exec \
  --overlay /<path>/pytorch1.8.0-cuda11.1.ext3:ro \
  --overlay /vast/work/public/ml-datasets/coco/coco-2014.sqf:ro \
  --overlay /vast/work/public/ml-datasets/coco/coco-2015.sqf:ro \
  --overlay /vast/work/public/ml-datasets/coco/coco-2017.sqf:ro \
  /scratch/work/public/singularity/cuda11.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu18.04.sif find /coco | wc -l

## Data Sets
### COCO Dataset

### ImageNet and ILSVRC
About data set: [ImageNet (image-net.org)](https://image-net.org/)

ImageNet is an image dataset organized according to the [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) hierarchy (Miller, 1995). Each concept in WordNet, possibly described by multiple words or word phrases, is called a “synonym set” or “synset”. ImageNet populates 21,841 synsets of WordNet with an average of 650 manually verified and full resolution images. As a result, ImageNet contains 14,197,122 annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet (as of August 2014). ImageNet is larger in scale and diversity than the other image classification datasets ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575)).

:::note 
WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept ([https://wordnet.princeton.edu/](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/))

#### ILSVRC (subset of ImageNet)

ILSVRC uses a subset of ImageNet images for training the algorithms and some of ImageNet’s image collection protocols for annotating additional images for testing the algorithms ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575)). The name comes from 'ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge ([ILSVRC](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2017/))'. Competition was moved to Kaggle ([http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2017/](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2017/))

*What is included* ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575)).
-   1000 object classes
-   approximately 1.2 million training images
-   50 thousand validation images
-   100 thousand test images
-   Size of data is about 150 GB (for train and validation)

*Dataset is available under*
-   `/scratch/work/public/ml-datasets/imagenet`
-   `/vast/work/public/ml-datasets/imagenet`
