# NYU VPN & HPC Gateway

If you are connecting from a remote location that is not on the NYU network (your home for example), you have two options: 

- `VPN Option`: set up your computer to use the NYU VPN. Once you've created a VPN connection, you can proceed as if you were connected to the NYU net.  

- `Gateway Option`: go through our gateway servers (example below). Gateways are designed to support only a very minimal set of commands and their only purpose is to let users connect HPC systems without needing to first connect to the VPN.

You do not need to use the NYU VPN or gateways if you are connected to the NYU network (wired connection in your office or WiFi) or if you have VPN connection initiated. In this case you can ssh directly to the clusters.
