# Secure Research Data Environment (SRDE)


The Secure Research Data Environment (SRDE) is a centralized secure computing platform designed to support research projects that require storage and computational resources.  It provides a space for researchers to design and build secure, scalable, and resilient environments to store, share, and analyze moderate and high-risk data, as per the [NYU Electronic Data and System Risk Classification Policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/electronic-data-and-system-risk-classification.html).

The Research Technology Services team leverages cloud computing resources to provide flexible, scalable, remotely accessible secure virtual environments. The team provides researchers with consultations and resources to comply with security requirements of research grants and Data Use Agreements (DUAs). SRDE resources intend to meet the security controls outlined in the NIST SP 800-171 to safeguard Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

For more information, please see the [SRDE Infographic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hrkjX4hCi1YBz9_8F0HjuoVu6360Vw6r/view).

## SRDE Eligibility

A project must be reviewed and approved by the University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) (or receive a waiver) in order to have an SRDE. Access to SRDE is available to NYU researchers and sponsored members of their research team (i.e. co-investigators, research assistants, external collaborators). SRDE project owners and requesters must be in one of the eligible positions to act as a project Primary Investigator (PI), as outlined by the [NYU IRB policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/policy-principal-investigator-project-director-status.html). This includes Tenured/Tenure Track Faculty, Continuing Contract faculty, Honorific Research Faculty, Professional Research Personnel, and Emeriti and retired faculty.  The SRDE project owner should be the same as the PI of the IRB protocol or waiver.  

Users on a research project must have valid and active NYU NetID credentials, including external, non-NYU collaborators, and be listed on the IRB protocol.  Non-NYU Researchers/Collaborators need to obtain an affiliate status to obtain access. A full-time NYU faculty member must sponsor a non-NYU collaborator for affiliate status. Please see instructions for [affiliate management](https://www.nyu.edu/servicelink/form/32a29460c441010075e6b00978cd4e53) (NYU NetID login is required to follow the link). A Data Steward must be a faculty member or university employee. 

A Data Steward must be designated for each research project using SRDE and will be solely responsible for the transport of data for the project’s SRDE. Only users approved according to the Data Provider’s requirements are permitted to access project workspaces and related resources. These individuals are required to go through our on-boarding process, which includes signing a User Agreement and agreeing to our Terms of Use.

## Requesting an SRDE Project

The SRDE form contains details about the project, such as if the project requires IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval, technical requirements (such as data storage and software). The form will be submitted to the SRDE team for review.

[Link to the Secure Research Data Environment Intake Form](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3Vok9ax87Bxxdsy).

After you submit the intake form, the SRDE team will review the submitted documents and will respond to schedule the consultation.
