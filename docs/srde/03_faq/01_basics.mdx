# About SRDE, projects and getting started

## What is the SRDE?
NYU Secure Research Data Environment (SRDE) is a centralized secure computing platform designed to support research projects that require storage, sharing and analysis of high risk datasets. The team provides researchers with consultations and resources to comply with security requirements of research grants and Data Use Agreements. SRDE resources intend to meet the security controls outlined in the NIST 800-171 to safeguard Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

For more technical information regarding the SRDE, please refer to [our technical description here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DB2eHL2Y6kd5fQWAif1QBgHbDBui1bpR_pjF_hcJIzI/edit?tab=t.0)

## Who can have an SRDE project?

Access to SRDE is available to NYU researchers and sponsored members of their research team (i.e. co-investigators, research assistants, external collaborators).

:::tip [IRB Waiver Requirement]
A project must be reviewed and approved (or receive a waiver) by the University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) in order to have an SRDE.

## How do I sign up for an SRDE?
Fill out our intake form to provide more information about your project: [Secure Research Data Environment intake form](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3Vok9ax87Bxxdsy). Once we have received your form, the team will review the information and will contact you to schedule the consultation.

## How much will the SRDE cost?
The cost is dependent on the needs of the project, such as size of the data and the type of machine needed for the analysis.  Google Cloud has a calculator that will help estimate the costs: https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator

## My data is not high risk, are there other options available?
There are several options available depending on the data risk classification and the needs of the project.  There are resources provided by the university such as research project space, cloud computing, etc. You can check out many of these services on the [HPC Support Site](../../hpc/01_getting_started). If you are unsure on how to proceed, a consultation with the SRDE team will help determine the best path forward.  

## What does the SRDE team need from me for the consultation?
To help get things started it would be beneficial to submit an [intake form](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3Vok9ax87Bxxdsy) with any related data governance documentation (files can be attached to the form), including, but not limited to, data use agreement, OSP/IRB documents, and project information.
