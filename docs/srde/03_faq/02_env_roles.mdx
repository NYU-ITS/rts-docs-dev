# Environment and Roles

## Who is the Data Steward?
The data steward is an individual who is responsible for the ingress and egress of the data.  The data steward is usually an IT administrator of the school the PI is associated with, they should be familiar with data sets and classification and may even cosign the Data Use Agreement (DUA) associated with the project.

:::warning [Data Steward role]
If there is no such person, the project PI will need to assign the role to someone who will NOT be analyzing the data in the SRDE since this role does not have access to the research workspace in the SRDE (to enforce separation of duties).  The SRDE team will provide role-based training for the data steward.

## Will other project users have access to my files?
Each user will have access to two drives within the SRDE workspace: home and scratch.  The home drive is private and the scratch drive is shared.  Any files for collaboration with other project team members on the workspace should be placed or copied over to the scratch drive.


## What kind of software is available on the SRDE?
Some statistical analysis software packages are preinstalled on the SRDE, such as Stata and MATLAB, other software is added on a case-by-case basis, dependent on the security and compatibility of the software with the SRDE.

## How long will the data stay in the SRDE?
Project lifecycle will be determined between the PI and the SRDE Team during the intake interview.
