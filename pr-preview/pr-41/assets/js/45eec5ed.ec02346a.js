Similar to other Linux clusters, the most common method of connection is via a Command Line Interface (CLI). A CLI is a program that allows you to create and delete files, run programs, and navigate through directories and files via a typed prompt. On Mac, the built-in CLI application is called Terminal. While Windows 11 machines support a Linux Subsystem, which allows for similar functionality, a popular tool used to connect to a Linux server is a free application called PuTTY.","sidebar":"hpcSidebar"},"hpc/connecting_to_hpc/ood":{"id":"hpc/connecting_to_hpc/ood","title":"Open OnDemand (Web-based Graphical User Interface)","description":"Open OnDemand is designed to create easier access to users to interface with HPC systems.
